    "This homework is for practicing Python’s *generators* and the design of *streaming* algorithms in general. We’re going to use the **taxi_events.csv** and **taxi_trips.csv** data sets. Both of them are available on NYU Classes under *Data Sets* section. You are required to turn in this notebook with all the parts filled in place of <###>. Your notebook must be named BDM\\_HW1\\_Streaming_NetID.ipynb."

    "Your task is to **compute the maximum number of active taxi cabs** that were hired at any point in time. This the same as computing the maximum number of taxi cabs that have passengers. The input data set is **taxi_events.csv**, which logged all pick-up and drop-off events for all taxi trips. The description of the fields in this file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Column name|Description|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|time |The timestamp of the event. All events are sorted increasingly by their timestamps. |\n",
    "|vehicle_id |The unique ID of the taxi vehicle involved in this event. |\n",
    "|event |A string of either *\"pickup\"* or *\"dropoff\"* for describing the drop-off or pick-up event, respectively. |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's assume that on *Feb-01-2015*, there was a taxi that picked up a passenger at midnight and dropped her off at 14 minutes past midnight. If the taxi cab has the Vehicle ID of *V102*, then you should see two events being logged in this data set as:\n",

    "...\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the above data set in a streaming fashion (reading in row by row), and must design a streaming algorithm that uses the least possible additional memory to compute the maximum number of hired taxi cabs at any point in time. Again, this is equivalent to having a virtual dispatcher, who repeatedly ask every second *\"how many taxis are being hired (having passengers) at the moment?\"*, and then log the maximum number during the entire period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please modify the code snippet below to complete this task. Your code should only output a single number, which is the maximum number of hired taxi cabs. Of course, you can add additional initialization codes outside of the for loop as needed. Additional, please provide a brief rationale and/or justification for your design after the code."

Then, if the there is any drop-off event, it will decrease the number of hired cabs. The maximum hired cabs is obtained if the number of hired cabs is more than maximum hired cabs (which at the begining I set it at 0) and I set the current number of hired cabs as the maximum hired cabs. As the code finish iterating each rows, it will give the result of maximum hired cabs."
